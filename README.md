# FairFly

FairFly is a fair temporal logic controller for UAVs (and other systems whose dynamical model you have).
It adds a fairness optimization on top of Fly-by-Logic. For completeness, this repo icludes a version of FbL in it, but for the latest FbL, please go to that project's repo, maintained by this gentleman https://yashpant.github.io/.

The FairFly-specific documentation is sparse (which is to say, non-existent). We're working on it!
The documentation you find here for now is for FbL. See the Documentation folder for details on the user interface and installation. 

FairFly was created by Connor Kurtz while at Oregon State University, working with Houssam Abbas (www.houssamabbas.com)
